/// (i)   Each UE has max 8 PUCCH F0/F1 and max 8 PUCCH F2/F3/F4 dedicated to HARQ-ACK reporting.
/// (ii)  Each UE has max 1 SR-dedicated PUCCH F0/F1 resource and max 1 CSI-dedicated PUCCH F2/F3/F4 resource.
/// (iii) The cell PUCCH resource list can have max \c MAX_NOF_CELL_PUCCH_RESOURCES PUCCH resource, including all
///       formats; at cell level, there is no constraint on how many resource must be F0/F1, F2/F3/F4, or for SR or for
///       CSI.
/// (vi)  UEs can have different PUCCH resource lists; however the PUCCH resource ID is unique with the cell. This
///       implies that if two UEs have the same PUCCH resource within their lists, their PUCCH resource ID must be the
///       same.
/// (v)   Indexing of the PUCCH F0/F1 and PUCCH F2/F3/F4 resources for HARQ-ACK reporting must be contiguous within the
/// F0/F1
///       group and with F2/F3/F4 group. However, the last PUCCH F0/F1 group resource's and the first PUCCH F2/F3/F4
///       group resource's indices need not be contiguous. E.g., PUCCH F0/F1 indices (for HARQ-ACK reporting) = {0, ...,
///       7}, and PUCCH F2/F3/F4 indices (for HARQ-ACK reporting) = {10, ..., 17}.
