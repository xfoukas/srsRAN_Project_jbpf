/// The produced PDU contains a PDCP data PDU header followed by an incremental sequence of bytes starting with the
/// value given by first_byte, i.e. if first_byte = 0xfc, the SDU will be <PDCP-HDR> 0xfc 0xfe 0xff 0x00 0x01 ...
/// The minimum sdu_size is 3 for 12-bit PDCP SNs and 4 for 18-bit PDCP SNs (i.e. PDCP-HDR + 1 or more bytes).
///
/// \param pdcp_sn_len Size of the PDCP sequence number
/// \param is_srb Determines the bearer type: SRB (true) or DRB (false).
/// \param pdcp_sn PDCP sequence number
/// \param sdu_size Size of the SDU (including PDCP header)
/// \param first_byte Value of the first payload byte after PDCP header
/// \return the produced SDU as a byte_buffer
