/// Recovers a UL-SCH transport block from a PUSCH codeword. Reverting the encoding operations described in TS38.212
/// Sections 6.2.1-6.2.6, the codeword is first split into rate-matched codeblocks. Then, each codeblock is restored
/// to its base rate, combined with previous retransmissions, and decoded. Finally, if all blocks pass the CRC check,
/// the data bits from all codeblocks are concatenated to form the UL-SCH transport block. If applicable, a last
/// transport-block CRC is computed and verified.
///
/// The PUSCH decoder is configured using the method \ref new_data. This method returns a \ref pusch_decoder_buffer
/// which is used to write softbits into the decoder.
///
/// The decoder could potentially start the code block processing if a codeword length is provided (see
/// \ref set_nof_softbits) prior \ref pusch_decoder_buffer::on_end_softbits.
