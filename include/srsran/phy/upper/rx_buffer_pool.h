/// The aim of this interface is to provide the physical layer shared channel decoder with receiver buffers.
///
/// The receiver buffers are selected from a pool of resources for a given trx_buffer_identifier and kept persistent
/// until the buffer is released or expires.
///
/// The pool is designed for being unique in a sector. In other words, every sector must create its own pool.
///
/// The implementation might not be thread safe: reserve(), and run_slot() can not be called simultaneously.
///
/// \remark An assertion is triggered if the slot numerology used for reserve() and run_slot() are different.

  /// It reserves a buffer for the given identifier. It guarantees that reserved buffers keep the CRC and data values.
  ///
  /// The buffers are reserved until:
  /// - the buffer is freed using unique_rx_buffer::release(),
  /// - a buffer reservation is performed with the same identifier but different number of codeblocks, or
  /// - buffer reservation expires (by means run_slot()).
  ///
  /// The pool does not initialize or modify the codeblock contents of the buffers. The modules that use the buffers are
  /// responsible for initializing and modifying their contents upon new transmissions.
  ///
  /// It is expected that the pool logs in \c PHY channel the context and the reason of a failed reservation. Possible
  /// reservation failures are:
  /// - Insufficient number of buffers, \ref rx_buffer_pool_config::nof_buffers buffers are reserved with different
  ///   identifiers;
  /// - Insufficient number of codeblocks, \ref rx_buffer_pool_config::max_nof_codeblocks codeblocks are currently
  ///   assigned to buffers;
  /// - A buffer with the same identifier is locked;
  /// - No buffer is found with the same identifier while the reservation is not marked as new data;
  /// - The number of codeblocks for a retransmission is different than the previous reservation; or
  /// - The pool operation has stopped.
