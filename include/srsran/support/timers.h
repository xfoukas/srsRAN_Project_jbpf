/// the allocation, destruction, starting/halting and timeout triggering of the registered timers. The user
/// can check and control the state of an individual timer via the respective \c unique_timer handle object.
///
/// The \c timer_manager and \c unique_timer classes follow a publisher/subscriber model. The \c timer_manager,
/// the publisher, receives periodic ticks from a clock source (e.g. RF front-end or system clock) that advance its
/// internal clock. It also contains an internal list of subscribed \c unique_timers. Once enough time has passed and
/// a running timer time-outs, the respective timer gets notified via a callback. The user can control the timer
/// starting time, duration until timeout and timeout callback function definition via the \c unique_timer interface.
///
/// The implementation assumes that the "tick()" method is always called from the same thread and that a unique_timer
/// object is not accessed concurrently by different threads. However, separate unique_timers can be safely used from
/// separate threads. A unique_timer object and the timer_manager communicate with one another via thread-safe queues.
