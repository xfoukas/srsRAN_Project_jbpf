/// producers/consumers supported. Supported types are:
/// - lockfree_spsc: lockfree single producer single consumer queue (SPSC).
/// - lockfree_mpmc: lockfree multiple producer multiple consumer queue (MPMC).
/// - locking_mpmc: multiple producer multiple consumer (MPMC) queue that uses a mutex for synchronization. It is the
/// most generic type of queue, but it is also the slowest. It relies on a condition variable to wake up producers and
/// consumers.
/// - locking_mpsc: similar to the locking_mpmc, but it leverages batch popping on the consumer side, to reduce
/// mutex contention.
/// - moodycamel_lockfree_mpmc: Lock-free MPMC queue with unbounded capacity and that does not ensure elements
/// enqueued by independent producers come out in the same order (not linearizable).
