#   This file contains the PUCCH configuration for the gNB to support:
#   - SR period 20ms or 40ms.
#   - CSI period 20ms or 40ms.
#   - Max 256 UEs.

#   NOTEs:
#   - This configuration is optimized for TDD 7D-2U configuration, but it still works for TDD configurations
#     with more than 2 UL slots.
#   - This configuration might work for more than 256 UEs, although it hasn't been tested for those scenarios.
